# Self-Driving Car Simulation with Neural Networks and Machine Learning
Learn neural networks by building a self-driving car simulation using JavaScript. 

In this project, we will implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network. The course covers how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. We will try and learn how to implement a neural network and how to visualize it so we can see it in action.

Covered topics:
- Car driving mechanics
- Defining the road
- Artificial sensors
- Collision detection
- Simulating traffic
- Neural network
- Parallelization
- Genetic algorithm
